# NJP Times

**The bold text on the menu was the first thing I noticed when I walked through the doors, and in an instant, it brought back a flood of memories.** My first encounter with *Not Just Paranthas*, or NJP as it’s affectionately known, was back in 2017. It wasn’t just another North Indian restaurant—it was a cornerstone of my food-loving years in Gurugram, the city I called home for most of my life until I moved to Singapore in 2024.

During my high school days and early undergraduate years, NJP was more than a restaurant. It was a gathering spot, a comfort zone, and a place that represented the warmth of home-cooked meals served with a twist of creativity. Its buttery paranthas stuffed with every imaginable filling, paired with flavorful curries and refreshing lassis, made it a go-to destination for family dinners, catch-ups with friends, and celebrations. For years, it was the place I would take anyone visiting me in Gurugram—a must-visit, a sure bet.  

**And then, it was gone.**  

The closure felt sudden, almost inexplicable. Was it the aftermath of Covid? A management shift? No one seemed to have a clear answer. All I knew was that one of my favorite dining spots had disappeared, leaving a void I hadn’t quite filled.

But in late 2024, NJP made its return after a long hiatus. Rebranded as *Not Just Paranthas*, the restaurant promised a new avatar, and I couldn’t help but feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. Would it still carry the charm and flavors I’d cherished? Or would it be a shadow of its former self, trying to adapt to a changed world?

Revisiting NJP felt almost like reconnecting with an old friend—familiar yet slightly different. As I stepped inside and took my first look at the revamped menu, I wondered: **was it worth the wait, or had time stripped away the magic?** Join me as I dive into this new chapter of Not Just Paranthas, and find out if it lives up to the memories.

## The Past Menu

Forget *Paranthe Wali Gali*—there was a time when *Not Just Paranthas* at Cyber Hub was **the** ultimate destination for parantha lovers. Back in its glory days, NJP wasn’t just a parantha joint; it was a haven for all things North Indian. Their menu was a treasure trove of indulgence—from smoky kebabs and rich curries to decadent desserts.  

And of course, the paranthas were the stars of the show, offering something for every craving:  
- Classic stuffed varieties  
- Italian pizza paranthas  
- Pocket paranthas  
- The unforgettable **Chur Chur Naan**

Ah, the **Chur Chur Naan**. These buttery, flaky, and delightfully crushed creations were pure magic—layered with just the right balance of spices and served piping hot. They were *the* dish everyone talked about—the one you had to order.

NJP didn’t just serve food; **they created an experience**. It was a place where family meals turned into feasts, and every bite felt like a celebration.

But with their reopening, much has changed. The new **NJP Times** brings a fresh identity. While some old favorites remain, the menu has taken a different direction. The focus has shifted, and the iconic *Chur Chur Paranthas* that once defined NJP seem to have taken a backseat.

**Nostalgia fills the air, but it’s met with curiosity** about what the new chapter holds. Has NJP evolved for the better, or has it lost the charm that made it so special?

## The Experience

The items I ordered were a careful selection—a mix of old favorites and intriguing additions from the revamped menu.  

- I started with the **Aloo Pyaz Lehsuni Chur Chur Parantha**—a warm, buttery creation that instantly brought back memories of late-night dinners and family outings. The filling was just as I remembered: perfectly spiced, with the soft potato and crunchy onion melding beautifully.

- Next came the **Chicken Khurchan Tacos**—a more modern twist on a classic. Tender, smoky chicken strips enveloped in the signature *ulte tawe ka paratha*. It was undeniably delicious and felt like a homage to the NJP of the past.

- To complete the meal, I opted for a portion of **Gulab Jamun and Rabri**, a staple from their earlier menu. Rich and creamy, it had the same comforting flavor that once made NJP a household name for North Indian food in Gurugram.

Despite my apprehension, the taste had that same spark—a reminder that **some things don’t change**.

That said, as I finished my meal, I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of longing for the original concept. The menu now leans heavily toward quick bites and fusion dishes, seemingly catering to a crowd that frequents the new location—a bustling area filled with trendy cafes and casual eateries.

It’s clear that NJP has **adapted to its surroundings**, but in doing so, it feels like it’s moved away from the family-style dining that once made it so special.

While the **flavors are still there**, and the **quality remains high**, the essence of the old NJP feels diluted.  

For someone like me, who treasures the memories of its earlier days, the new NJP is both a **welcome return and a bittersweet reminder** of what’s been left behind. Perhaps this is the price of evolution—meeting the tastes of a different audience while holding on to pieces of the past.

**Would I return?**  
Maybe. But I’d do so knowing that NJP is now a mix of **nostalgia and novelty**, a reflection of how much the world—and perhaps I—have changed since 2017.
