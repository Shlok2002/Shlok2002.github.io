Having moved to Singapore to pursue my master’s at NUS, I was brimming with excitement to dive into the local food scene. Among the many culinary treasures I’d read about, one thing stood out—the unique **kopitiam** culture that’s woven into the fabric of Singaporean life. Yet, as a staunch lover of the classic chai and coffee from back home, I couldn’t help but wonder: could this beloved local brew truly rival the familiar comfort of my favorite cuppa?  
*(Fun fact: If you’re a chai fan too, check out my piece on **Naveen Tea House**! (WIP))*

During my move, I had spotted a humble coffee shop just a few meters from my new apartment—a no-frills kopitiam bustling with locals. I made a mental note to try it as soon as I settled in. For me, trying something as fundamental as a cup of coffee felt oddly significant—it wasn’t just about the drink; it was about setting the tone for my food exploration in the Lion City. Call me dramatic, but I was convinced that a single cup of kopi could either fuel my excitement or leave me pining for home.  
(And yes, this was only my second week in Singapore!)

After diving into multiple Reddit threads and food blogs, I finally landed on a kopi combination that seemed like a safe bet for my taste buds. Now, I’m excited to share my first kopi-ordering experience and the story of how it unfolded. Let’s just say it was anything but ordinary!

## The Ordering Experience

I walk towards the coffee house, my combination specification firmly memorized, quietly reciting it under my breath like a mantra. Stepping into the bustling kopitiam, I instinctively glance upwards, searching for a menu—a habit ingrained from countless trips to coffee chains where glossy boards dictate your choices. But there’s no menu to be found here. Instead, I’m greeted by a Singlish-speaking, middle-aged *auntie* with an unmistakable Hokkien undertone.

> **"What you wan?!"**

She fires off the words rapid and sharp, catching me slightly off-guard. It’s not a polite _“What can I get for you today?”_ like at Starbucks. No name inquiries, no cheery smile, and certainly no barista waiting with a marker to scribble “Shlok” (or some hilariously butchered version of it) on a paper cup. It’s efficient, unvarnished, and refreshingly direct.

Caught off-guard, I blurt out:

> **“Kopi O Kosong!”**

...hoping I nailed the pronunciation. She pauses, gives me a scrutinizing look, and repeats my order back, emphasizing every syllable as if to test my commitment:

> **“Kopi...O...Kosong?”**

I nod quickly, like a student trying to pass a surprise oral test. She gestures towards a QR code for payment and rattles off the amount. As I fumble with my phone, she’s already moved to prepare my drink, her movements swift and precise.

At first, I’m in awe. No name stickers, no customization requests, no waiting for a paper cup adorned with foam art. Here, coffee comes in a simple, no-nonsense beer mug filled with ice and kopi. It’s stripped-down and unapologetically practical—an efficiency I can’t help but admire.

While my thoughts race, the drink is ready in record time. Kopitiams don’t waste a second—there are no lengthy waits, no queues of people agonizing over whether to get oat milk or soy. The *auntie* points to the counter where my mug sits, and I grab a straw before heading to a seat facing the street. From ordering to receiving my drink, the entire interaction barely lasts 90 seconds.

As I take my seat, I marvel at the simplicity of the process. It’s unpolished yet strangely charming—a stark contrast to the polished predictability of global coffee chains. And as I sit there with my mug of kopi, watching the world pass by, I realize that this 90-second encounter has introduced me to a world of authenticity I didn’t know I was missing.

## The Taste and Verdict

I take my first sip, letting the cold brew slide through the straw and hit my taste buds. The bitterness is immediate and bold, like a wake-up call in liquid form, but there’s a subtle depth to it that catches me off guard. It’s not just coffee—it’s *kopi*, uniquely Singaporean. The absence of sugar or milk makes the flavors unapologetically raw, and the chill from the ice mellows it out just enough, making it oddly refreshing.

As I sit there savoring the drink, I replay the process I’d just witnessed. The *auntie* had ladled a generous scoop of coffee powder—likely robusta beans roasted with margarine and sugar, as is traditional—into a cloth filter that looked like a well-worn sock. She poured hot water over it, letting the dark liquid drip into a pot with practiced precision. The result? A concentrated brew, rich and thick, that she then poured over a mug full of ice to create the perfect *Kopi O Kosong Peng*—iced black coffee with no sugar.

I find myself appreciating the simplicity of it all. There’s no fancy machine, no meticulously weighed shots, just a tried-and-true method honed over generations. The taste feels nostalgic even though it’s my first time trying it, like it carries the history of kopitiam culture in every sip.

**Verdict?**  
This isn’t your average cold brew. It’s intense, earthy, and deeply satisfying. Sure, it’s not the creamy, sugary comfort of a chai back home, but it’s its own kind of comfort—an acquired taste that’s worth acquiring. And as I sip the last of my kopi, I realize something: this humble drink has officially set the stage for my culinary exploration in Singapore.

If the rest of the food scene is anything like this, I’m in for a delicious adventure.
