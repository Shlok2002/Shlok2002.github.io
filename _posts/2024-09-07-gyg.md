# My Mexican Food Detour in Singapore 

Back in India, **Taco Bell** was my ultimate go-to for a quick Mexican fix. Whether it was a spontaneous post-class meal or a late-night craving for crunchy tacos and cheesy quesadillas, Taco Bell always delivered (both literally and figuratively).  

It wasn’t just fast food—it was **comfort food**, a guilty pleasure that hit all the right notes.

Naturally, when I moved to Singapore, I assumed I’d find a Taco Bell somewhere, ready to fill the same void.

But to my shock, there was **no Taco Bell in sight**.  
I searched malls, scrolled through food delivery apps, and even Googled *“Taco Bell Singapore”* in a desperate attempt to uncover a hidden branch.  

The result? **Nada.**  
My beloved tacos, burritos, and chalupas were nowhere to be found. I was, to put it mildly, **devastated**.

> Taco Bell’s short stint in Singapore during the 1990s ended in disappointment, largely due to pricing that didn’t resonate with the local market.

Left without my beloved tacos and chalupas, I set out to fill the void—unknowingly embarking on a **culinary detour** that would lead me to a new favorite.

## 🌯 The GYG Discovery: A Mexican Detour on an SBS Bus

My introduction to **Guzman Y Gomez (GYG)** was as serendipitous as it was exciting.

On a regular commute to university, I spotted a **vibrant advertisement** plastered across an SBS Transit bus. The colorful images of burritos, tacos, and nachos grabbed my attention instantly, promising **authentic Mexican flavors**.

Intrigued, I decided to give GYG a shot.  
Little did I know, this fast-food chain would soon **redefine my Mexican food experience in Singapore**.

## Let’s TACO About It! 🌮🌮🌮

I’ve always been fascinated by cuisines that bring bold, vibrant flavors to the table.  

While Mediterranean food has always held a special place in my heart with its clever use of spices and herbs, **Mexican food is in a league of its own**.

So when I came across **Guzman Y Gomez (GYG)** during my commute to university (thanks to that brightly colored SBS Transit bus ad!), I knew I had to give it a shot.

### What sets GYG apart?

GYG focuses on:
- **Fresh, all-natural ingredients**
- **Bold, authentic flavors**

From **soft tortillas** to **juicy pan-seared barramundi**, **slow-roasted beef**, and **creamy guacamole**, every bite feels like a carefully crafted celebration of Mexican cuisine.

### 🌮 The GYG Taco Experience

One bite into their tacos, and I was **hooked**.  

Wrapped in a fresh tortilla, each taco bursts with layers of flavor:
- Nutty black beans  
- Fluffy rice  
- Savory Australian Jack cheese  
- Refreshing chopped tomato salsa  
- Their house-blend salsa 🌶️

And let’s not forget the **guacamole**!  
Thick, creamy, and perfectly seasoned, it’s the ultimate companion to their **crispy house-made corn chips**.

## My Favorite Combo 💕

My personal favorite?  
**The taco platter**, paired with a **Jarrito**—a fizzy Mexican soda with fruity flavors like guava and lime.  

It’s a combination that perfectly balances:
- **Rich textures**  
- **Refreshing sweetness**
