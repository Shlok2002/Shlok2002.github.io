I am a final-year [Business Analytics (MSBA)](https://msba.nus.edu.sg) candidate at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg), passionate about driving data-powered innovation across financial services, technology, and climate sectors.  
My academic focus spans financial risk analytics, healthcare analytics, and consumer tech applications, where I combine analytical depth with strategic thinking to solve real-world business challenges.

In April 2025, I will be joining [EY Singapore](https://www.ey.com/en_sg) as a technology consultant within the [AI & Data](https://www.ey.com/en_sg/alliances/microsoft/data-ai-services) team, where I’ll work on implementation projects to help clients solve complex problems through technology-driven solutions.

Most recently, I was a data analyst intern at [Arta Finance](https://artafinance.com), where I automated AUM tracking (saving advisory teams 15+ hours weekly), built a semantic data layer to simplify analytics, and co-developed a platform powering [Arta’s AI suite](https://artafinance.com/global/arta-ai) for its “Wealth as a Service” offering.

Before NUS, I was an analyst at [Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com) in New Delhi, focusing on data and technology within the performance improvement practice.  
I worked on operations excellence benchmarking and cost transformation projects, including Bain’s proprietary [Buy Better + Spend Better®](https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/operations/procurement/) framework.  
In 2024, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/home), India, with distinction.

I also interned at [Paisabazaar.com](https://www.paisabazaar.com), India's largest platform for financial products, developing prediction models for credit card limits and disbursals.  
Prior roles include internships at [TransOrg Analytics](https://www.transorg.com/) and [Spenny](https://spenny.com/) (now part of CRED), a Y Combinator-backed micro-savings app.

I am best reached by email at [shlok.kamat@comp.nus.edu.sg](mailto:shlok.kamat@comp.nus.edu.sg).  
Feel free to reach out about my university experience, internships, or anything else I might be able to help with.
