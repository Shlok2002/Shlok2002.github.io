  I am currently pursuing an <strong><a href="https://msba.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">M.S. in Business Analytics (MSBA)</a></strong> at the <strong><a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a></strong>.

  I am a data analyst (intern) at <strong><a href="https://artafinance.com/" target="_blank">Arta Finance</a></strong>. This hands-on role allows me to deepen my understanding of the finance industry, particularly in data-driven decision-making, while directly impacting Arta's growth trajectory.

  Before joining NUS, I gained valuable experience as an Analyst Intern at <strong><a href="https://www.bain.com/" target="_blank">Bain & Company</a></strong> in New Delhi, specializing in data & technology within the performance improvement practice. My work focused on enhancing operations excellence benchmarking capabilities and leading procurement-related cost transformation projects, including Bain’s proprietary <strong><a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/buy-better-spend-better/" target="_blank">Buy Better + Spend Better®</a></strong> framework.

  Previously, I interned at <strong><a href="https://www.paisabazaar.com/" target="_blank">Paisabazaar.com</a></strong>, India's largest and most trusted platform for financial products, developing prediction models for credit card limits and disbursals. I also interned at <strong><a href="https://www.transorg.com/" target="_blank">TransOrg Analytics</a></strong> and worked part-time at <strong><a href="https://www.spennyapp.com/" target="_blank">Spenny</a></strong> (now part of <strong><a href="https://cred.club/" target="_blank">CRED</a></strong>), a Y-combinator backed micro-savings app.
